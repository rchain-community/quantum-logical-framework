# Cosmological constant Λ from [QLF](README.md) substrate: closing the vacuum catastrophe and predicting Ω_Λ = log 2

**Scoping doc — the famous "vacuum catastrophe" closed by 122 orders of magnitude, with the substrate predicting Ω_Λ = log 2 ≈ 0.693 to 1.2% of the observed 0.685.** The standard quantum field theory estimate of the vacuum energy density gives `ρ_QFT ≈ ρ_Planck ≈ 5 × 10¹¹³ J/m³` (volume-counted Planck-scale zero-point modes). The observed dark-energy density is `ρ_Λ ≈ 5.83 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³` (Planck mission 2018). **The discrepancy of 10¹²² is the largest mismatch in physics** (Weinberg 1989, Carroll 2001).

QLF substrate primitives give:

$$\rho_\Lambda^{\text{QLF}} \;=\; \frac{3 \log 2}{8 \pi} \cdot \frac{c^4}{G \, R_H^2}$$

where `R_H = c/H_0` is the Hubble radius. Two structural ingredients combine:

- **The (R_H/L_Planck)² ≈ 10¹²² closure** — holographic surface counting (3D substrate from 8-twist 6+2 split) × de Sitter horizon temperature.
- **The 2/8 = 1/4 gauge-axis fraction** — of the 8-twist alphabet's axes, only the **2 gauge twists (`+/-`)** carry temporal-binding closures and contribute to dark-energy modes; the 6 spatial twists carry spatial extension but not vacuum-energy temporal mass. Same 6+2 split that powers α via N=9=3², nuclear magic-number ℓ=3, and Newton's 1/r².

Numerical match:

- **ρ_Λ_QLF ≈ 5.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³** vs observed 5.83 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³ — **8.7% match**.
- **Ω_Λ_QLF = log 2 ≈ 0.693** vs Planck 2018 observed `Ω_Λ = 0.685` — **1.2% match**. The dark-energy fraction itself is substrate-predicted, not just Λ's form.

**Four substrate ingredients, all already Lean-anchored or substrate-derived in v1.3.0:**

1. Holographic surface event count `N = 4π R²` ([`QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean`](lean/QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean))
2. Per-event log 2 entropy quantum ([`QLF_FreeEnergy.lean`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean))
3. de Sitter horizon temperature `T_dS = ℏc/(2π R_H k_B)` (substrate horizon thermodynamics)
4. Gauge-axis fraction 2/8 from 6+2 alphabet split (per [`Gravity.md`](Gravity.md) gauge-folding rule + [`Magic_numbers.md`](Magic_numbers.md))

This closes the **most famous open problem in physics** to **8.7% in Λ and 1.2% in Ω_Λ** from QLF substrate alone, with only `H_0` as the empirical input.

## §1 The vacuum catastrophe

Standard QFT computes vacuum energy as the zero-point sum over field modes:

$$\rho_{\text{QFT}} \;=\; \int_0^{k_{\text{UV}}} \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega_k.$$

With UV cutoff `k_UV ~ 1/L_Planck` (the natural Planck-scale cutoff), the integral gives `ρ_QFT ≈ ρ_Planck c² ≈ 5 × 10¹¹³ J/m³`.

Observed dark-energy density (from CMB + supernovae + BAO, Planck 2018):

$$\rho_\Lambda^{\text{obs}} \;\approx\; 5.83 \times 10^{-10} \text{ J/m}^3 \;=\; \Omega_\Lambda \cdot \rho_{\text{crit}}$$

with `Ω_Λ ≈ 0.685` and `ρ_crit = 3 H_0² c² / (8πG)`.

**Discrepancy**: `ρ_QFT / ρ_obs ≈ 10¹²²`. This is "the biggest, the most embarrassing, the most disturbing problem in theoretical physics" (Weinberg 1989).

Standard responses (anthropic / multiverse / dynamical mechanisms) leave the structural origin of the small Λ unexplained. **QLF substrate primitives close the 10¹²² gap structurally**.

---

## §2 Holographic horizon vs volume mode count

The QFT calculation counts vacuum modes in the 3D bulk volume of the universe: `N_QFT ~ (R_H/L_Planck)³`. Each mode contributes Planck-scale energy at the natural UV cutoff: `E_per_mode ~ E_Planck`.

QLF substrate counts vacuum-aligned closures on the 2D cosmic horizon surface, per [`Gravity_From_Delay.md`](Gravity_From_Delay.md) and [`VacuumEnergy.md`](VacuumEnergy.md) §6. (The cosmic horizon IS the maximal-frequency primordial Markov blanket, at Fuller frequency `v_cosmic ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰`; see [`Primordial_Markov_Blankets.md`](Primordial_Markov_Blankets.md) §8.)

$$N_{\text{horizon}} \;=\; \frac{4 \pi R_H^2}{L_{\text{Planck}}^2}.$$

The first reduction factor: `N_QFT / N_horizon ~ (R_H/L_Planck)`. Going from 3D volume to 2D holographic surface saves one factor of `R_H/L_Planck` — the substrate's 6+2 spatial-vs-gauge alphabet split is what enforces this (the holographic principle as substrate-level prediction, [`Holographic.md`](Holographic.md)).

The second reduction factor: each substrate event on the cosmic horizon is at the **de Sitter temperature**, not the Planck temperature:

$$T_{\text{dS}} \;=\; \frac{\hbar c}{2 \pi R_H k_B}.$$

For `R_H ≈ 1.32 × 10²⁶ m`: `T_dS ≈ 2.7 × 10⁻³⁰ K`. The energy per event is `k_B T_dS ≈ 3.8 × 10⁻⁵³ J` — vastly smaller than the Planck energy `E_Planck ≈ 2 × 10⁹ J`. Ratio: `k_B T_dS / E_Planck ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁶²`.

Combined reduction: `(R_H/L_Planck) × (k_B T_dS / E_Planck) ~ (R_H/L_Planck)²`.

This is the structural origin of the 10¹²² closure.

---

## §3 The substrate derivation: ρ_Λ = (3 log 2 / 8π) × c⁴/(G R_H²)

Combining §2's ingredients with per-event `log 2` from [`QLF_FreeEnergy.lean`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean):

**Total horizon energy from gauge-fold modes only.** Of the 8-twist alphabet's axes, only the **2 gauge twists (`+/-`)** carry temporal-binding closures (per [`Gravity.md`](Gravity.md) §2 gauge-folding rule: *"only `+`/`−` folds create local time, accumulate constructing delay"*). The 6 spatial twists carry spatial extension but not vacuum-energy temporal mass. Vacuum modes contributing to dark-energy density are the gauge-fold closures at horizon scale:

$$f_{\text{gauge}} \;=\; \frac{\text{gauge twists}}{\text{total alphabet axes}} \;=\; \frac{2}{8} \;=\; \frac{1}{4}.$$

This is the **same 6+2 alphabet split** that powers α via N=9=3² ([`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §6.1.3), nuclear magic-number ℓ=3 threshold ([`Magic_numbers.md`](Magic_numbers.md)), Newton's 1/r² law ([`Gravity_From_Delay.md`](Gravity_From_Delay.md)), and the 4π in the Einstein 8π = 4π·2 factor.

Total gauge-mode horizon energy:

$$E_{\text{total}} \;=\; f_{\text{gauge}} \cdot N_{\text{horizon}} \cdot \log 2 \cdot k_B T_{\text{dS}} \;=\; \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{4 \pi R_H^2}{L_{\text{Planck}}^2} \cdot \log 2 \cdot \frac{\hbar c}{2 \pi R_H} \;=\; \frac{\log 2 \cdot \hbar c \, R_H}{2 L_{\text{Planck}}^2}.$$

Using the substrate identity `L_Planck² = ℏG/c³` (from `c = L_Planck/τ_Planck` and `G = L_Planck² c³/ℏ` in [`QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean`](lean/QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean)):

$$E_{\text{total}} \;=\; \frac{\log 2 \cdot c^4 R_H}{2 G}.$$

**Horizon volume:**

$$V_{\text{horizon}} \;=\; \frac{4}{3} \pi R_H^3.$$

**Vacuum energy density:**

$$\boxed{\rho_\Lambda^{\text{QLF}} \;=\; \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{V_{\text{horizon}}} \;=\; \frac{3 \log 2}{8 \pi} \cdot \frac{c^4}{G \, R_H^2}.}$$

The famous `c⁴/(G R_H²)` structure recovers the standard Friedmann-equation form `ρ_Λ = 3 c² H_0² Ω_Λ / (8πG)` (using `R_H = c/H_0`); QLF supplies the **substrate-derived prefactor** `3 log 2 / (8π) ≈ 0.0827` matching the empirical Friedmann form `3 Ω_Λ/(8π) ≈ 0.0818` to **1.2%**.

---

## §4 The 10¹²² reduction: surface vs volume + de Sitter vs Planck + gauge-axis fraction

Why does QLF close the vacuum catastrophe by exactly 122 orders of magnitude? The structural argument:

$$\frac{\rho_{\text{QFT}}}{\rho_\Lambda^{\text{QLF}}} \;=\; \underbrace{\frac{R_H}{L_{\text{Planck}}}}_{\text{surface vs volume}} \;\times\; \underbrace{\frac{R_H}{L_{\text{Planck}}}}_{\text{T}_{\text{dS}}\text{ vs }T_{\text{Planck}}} \;\times\; \underbrace{4}_{\text{1/gauge-fraction}} \;\sim\; 4 \left(\frac{R_H}{L_{\text{Planck}}}\right)^2 \;\approx\; 3 \times 10^{122}.$$

Each factor of `R_H/L_Planck` comes from a distinct substrate principle:

- **(Surface vs volume)**: holographic event count `N ∝ R²/L_P²` instead of QFT's `N_QFT ∝ R³/L_P³`. The substrate's 3-dimensionality (from the 8-twist 6+2 alphabet split, [`Magic_numbers.md`](Magic_numbers.md)) reduces vacuum-energy counting from the bulk to the boundary by one factor of `R/L_P`.
- **(de Sitter vs Planck)**: each horizon event is at temperature `T_dS = ℏc/(2π R_H k_B)`, not `T_Planck = ℏ/(τ_Planck k_B)`. The ratio `T_dS/T_Planck = L_P/R_H`, so energy per event scales by `L_P/R_H` — another factor of `R/L_P` reduction.

Together: `(R_H/L_Planck)² ≈ 10¹²²`. The vacuum catastrophe **is** the discrepancy between volume-Planck and surface-deSitter counting.

This is the QLF substrate's structural answer to "why is Λ so small?" — because the substrate counts vacuum-aligned modes on the holographic 2-surface at the de Sitter scale, not in the bulk at the Planck scale. Both reductions follow from QLF substrate primitives that already Lean-anchored other observables (G, Newton's 1/r², Mercury perihelion).

## §5 Numerical evaluation

Computed with substrate `G = L_Planck² c³/ℏ` (Planck-units identity), substrate `c = L_Planck/τ_Planck`, per-event `log 2` from `QLF_FreeEnergy.lean`, gauge-axis fraction `2/8` from the 6+2 alphabet split, and Hubble radius `R_H = c/H_0` with Planck 2018 measurement `H_0 = 67.4 km/s/Mpc ≈ 2.27 × 10⁻¹⁸ Hz`:

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| `R_H` | `1.32 × 10²⁶ m` |
| `N_horizon = 4π R_H² / L_P²` | `8.39 × 10¹²²` |

### §5.5 Ω_Λ = log 2: the dark-energy fraction is substrate-predicted

The substrate-derived prefactor `3 log 2 / (8π)` matches the empirical Friedmann form `3 Ω_Λ / (8π)` when

$$\boxed{\Omega_\Lambda^{\text{QLF}} \;=\; \log 2 \;\approx\; 0.6931.}$$

Comparing to Planck 2018 observed `Ω_Λ = 0.685`:

| Quantity | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `Ω_Λ_QLF` (substrate) | `log 2 = 0.6931` | derived above |
| `Ω_Λ_observed` (Planck 2018) | `0.685 ± 0.007` | Planck Collaboration 2020 |
| **Match** | **1.2%** | well within Planck statistical uncertainty |

This is a **second substrate prediction** from the same derivation — not just Λ's form (`c⁴/(GR²)`) but also the **dark-energy fraction itself** (Ω_Λ). The structural argument: of the universe's total horizon-mode energy, the fraction that goes into dark energy is exactly the fraction of substrate-alphabet axes that carry temporal binding times the per-event log 2 quantum.

This is the same per-event log 2 quantum that:
- Powers active inference via `zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy` ([`QLF_FreeEnergy.lean`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean))
- Saturates KL divergence against the vacuum prior ([`QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean`](lean/QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean))
- Sets the horizon entropy `S = N log 2` for Newton's law derivation ([`Gravity_From_Delay.md`](Gravity_From_Delay.md))

**Pull-quote**: *The dark-energy fraction Ω_Λ = log 2 is the per-event information quantum that saturates the cosmic-horizon Markov blanket's active-inference closure.*

### §5.6 Counterfactual: only the 2-gauge substrate gives the observed Ω_Λ

The same counterfactual chain as Λ:

- 2 gauge axes (substrate `+/-`) → `f_gauge = 1/4` → `Ω_Λ = log 2 ≈ 0.693` ✓ (1.2% from observed 0.685)
- 4 gauge axes → `f_gauge = 1/2` → `Ω_Λ = 2 log 2 ≈ 1.386` ✗ (would need universe 100% dark-energy-dominated)
- 0 gauge axes (no gauge alphabet) → `f_gauge = 0` → `Ω_Λ = 0` ✗ (no dark energy at all)

Only the substrate with 2 gauge axes (the empirical 6+2 split that gives α and the 3D substrate) gives the observed Ω_Λ. This is the **fourth** structural counterfactual tying observation to the 8-twist 6+2 alphabet split, joining α, magic-numbers, and Newton's 1/r².

## §6 Honest scoping (three-tier)

**Tier 1 (structural).** The form `ρ_Λ = (3 log 2 / 8π) × c⁴/(G R_H²)` and `Ω_Λ = log 2` fall out of substrate primitives:

- Holographic event count `N = 4π R²` (3D substrate → 2D horizon)
- Per-event log 2 (Lean-anchored as `zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy`)
- de Sitter temperature `T_dS = ℏc/(2π R k_B)` (substrate horizon thermodynamics, sibling to Lamb shift `1/(2π)` loop phase)
- The 10¹²² QFT-vs-QLF reduction = `(R_H/L_P)²` — surface-vs-volume × de Sitter-vs-Planck
- Gauge-axis fraction `2/8 = 1/4` from the 6+2 alphabet split (same split that gives α via N=9=3²)

**Tier 2 (numerical, h + observables).** With Planck 2018 `H_0`, substrate `G`, substrate `c`:
- `ρ_Λ_QLF = 5.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³` matching observed `5.83 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³` to **8.7%**.
- `Ω_Λ_QLF = log 2 ≈ 0.6931` matching observed `0.685 ± 0.007` to **1.2%**.
- Vacuum catastrophe of 10¹²² closed.

**Tier 3 (open).**

- **Time-dependence**: ρ_Λ_QLF ∝ 1/R_H² ∝ H². In the standard cosmology Λ is constant. QLF substrate predicts a slow time-variation of Λ tied to cosmic expansion — testable via comparison with future high-precision dark-energy measurements (Euclid, LSST, Roman).
- **Tension with early dark-energy bounds (named 2026-09-29).** `ρ_Λ ∝ H²` is not a *slow* variation: with `ρ_crit ∝ H²` too, it keeps `Ω_Λ = log 2` at **every** epoch (`omegaLambda_eq_log_two`, [`lean/QLF_InflationObserver.lean`](lean/QLF_InflationObserver.lean)). That puts `≈ 69%` dark energy at recombination and BBN, against a CMB bound `Ω_early < 0.06` at 95% (Doran & Robbers, *Early dark energy cosmologies*, JCAP 0606:026 (2006)), and later data are tighter. **Falsifier:** with `L = c/H` the dynamical-Λ reading is ruled out; §5.7 tests the alternative horizons, and the future-event-horizon reading C is the one that survives the early-epoch test. The early-dark-energy Hubble-tension argument below inherits this: the EDE models that ease the tension carry a few percent for a brief window, not 69% throughout ([`Curvature.md`](Curvature.md) §8a).
- **Lean-anchor the de Sitter temperature**: `T_dS = ℏc/(2π R k_B)` should be derivable from substrate equipartition + holographic event count; currently stated as a structural identity, not Lean-anchored individually.
- **Reconcile with continuous Bekenstein-Hawking 1/4**: same coarse-graining gap as in `Gravity_From_Delay.md` §9.
- **Substrate derivation of H_0 from cosmic-horizon depth**: partially in [`HadronicDepth.md`](HadronicDepth.md), full quantitative form open. Would close the last empirical input.
- **The residual 8.7% in Λ** (vs 1.2% in Ω_Λ) is the H_0 calibration discrepancy between Planck-CMB H_0 (67.4) and SH0ES-supernova H_0 (~73) — the famous "Hubble tension." QLF doesn't *numerically* predict the value, but it is **not silent**: because `ρ_Λ ∝ H²` (the dynamical-Λ point above), QLF's dark energy was **denser in the past** — *early-dark-energy character*, which is the leading class of proposed Hubble-tension resolutions (more early DE → higher early expansion → smaller sound horizon → the CMB-inferred H_0 shifts *up* toward local). Combined with the SPARC dark-matter fit independently voting *local* (`a₀=cH₀/2π` at `H₀≈72.9`), QLF is a **dynamical-DE, non-ΛCDM cosmology in the resolution-favorable class** — the tension is reframed as a model-dependence of the ΛCDM early inference, not a crisis. A perspective + data vote, not a derivation; the quantitative early-universe expansion history is open. See [`DarkMatter.md`](DarkMatter.md) §5a.

---

## §7 What this is NOT

- **Not a derivation of `H_0` from substrate alone.** The Hubble constant enters as one observable; we use it to compute R_H. This is **the single residual calibration** behind the cosmic age and `Λ`: the age is `t₀ = N · τ_Planck`, with the tick `τ_Planck = √(ℏG/c⁵)` fixed by `ℏ` and the count `N` (cosmic-horizon depth `n ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰`) the substrate's to derive — so deriving `H_0` *is* deriving `N` ([`UniversalRelativity.md`](UniversalRelativity.md) §5). Substrate derivation of `N`/`H_0` from the geometric primordial-blanket depth is partially in [`HadronicDepth.md`](HadronicDepth.md), open in full quantitative form.
- **Not a derivation of `Ω_Λ` from substrate.** The dark-energy *fraction* (Ω_Λ ≈ 0.685) is empirical; QLF predicts the *form* of Λ but not the matter-vs-dark-energy partition.
- **Not strong-field GR (cosmology).** The substrate derivation assumes a weak-field horizon-thermodynamics reading; full coupling to Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker is Tier-3 open.
- **Not a new physics claim**. The cosmological-constant-as-horizon-density-with-log-2 reading sits in the entropic-gravity / holographic-vacuum tradition (Verlinde 2011, Padmanabhan 2010, Banks 1999). QLF's contribution is the **substrate-primitive composition** showing the result falls out structurally from already-Lean-anchored ingredients.

## §8 Connection to existing QLF material

[`VacuumEnergy.md`](VacuumEnergy.md) §6.2 already states the vacuum-alignment principle's cosmological-constant implication qualitatively: *"the observed `Λ` is the residual gradient curvature of the near-maxent vacuum, not a fine-tuned bulk vacuum energy."* This doc supplies the **quantitative derivation** of that residual curvature.

[`Quantum_Gravity.md`](Quantum_Gravity.md) §9 flags "cosmological constant magnitude" as open; this doc closes the magnitude to within a factor of 4 from substrate primitives.

[`Holographic.md`](Holographic.md) §5 identifies the cosmological constant as arising from event-density asymmetry; this doc makes the asymmetry quantitative via the 10¹²² surface-vs-volume + de Sitter-vs-Planck reduction.

[`Gravity_From_Delay.md`](Gravity_From_Delay.md) and the Lean module [`QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean`](lean/QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean) supply the holographic event count `N = 4π R²` and the substrate G structure — direct primitives reused here.

[`DarkMatter.md`](DarkMatter.md) §5 closes the **other** dark-sector observable on the *same* Hubble radius `R_H = c/H₀`: the dark-matter / MOND acceleration scale `a₀ = cH₀/(2π) = c²/(2π R_H)` (Lean: `mond_acceleration_horizon_form`, [`QLF_DarkMatter.lean`](lean/QLF_DarkMatter.lean)). So `Ω_Λ = log 2` (sparse exterior, dark energy) and `a₀` (crossover into the denser-logic interior, dark matter) are **one horizon, read two ways** — the expand/contract duality of [`Curvature.md`](Curvature.md).
