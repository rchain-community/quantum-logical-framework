# QLF_QuarkSignature — colour-blind gauge twists and the u/d twist signature

Two results from `Carbon_Superconductivity.md` §27b and §30.

**§27b amendment (adopted 2026-10-03).** A colour line is moved by the Weyl displacement of a *spatial*
twist and is left alone by a *gauge* twist. `colourVec` sends gauge twists to `0` and agrees with
`QLF_ColourFlux.colVec` on spatial twists. So the spatial 2π/3 flux is unchanged, and the W, a single
gauge twist, does not change a quark's colour displacement (`colour_blind_W`, for every word).

**§30 quark signature (u-bare).** The up quark is the positive twist on its colour axis, and the down quark
is that twist followed by `+`. Charge is `Q = (2/3)N − n_g`, with `N` the net spatial count and `n_g` the net
gauge count. In units of `1/3`, that is `charge3`:
* `charge3_rev` — the charge is conserved: reversal negates it.
* `charge3_cyc` — the charge is colour-blind: the colour cycle preserves it.
* Hadron charges: `p = +1`, `n = 0`.
* `beta_decay_charge` — charge balances in `n → p e⁻ ν̄`.
* `lock_word` — the §29 lock `3Q + N ≡ 0 (mod 3)` holds for every word.
